  <h3 class="w3-center">WHO AM I?</h3>
  <p>
  I go by the name Kanns on the internet and I try my hardest to develop code for all sort of things. I have created themes, tweaks, scripts and websites. I am based in the united kingdom.
  <pre>

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">TWEAKS</h3>
  My main focuses are creating tweaks for IOS jailbreaks. You can see my projects below. IOS jailbreak is where you exploit a bug found in the software of your IOS device and then install tweaks (code) to modify and create cool things and remove the restrictions that apple put on your device.

  <h3 class="w3-center">JAILBREAK FOR ME</h3>
  What is jailbreaking for me? For me, jailbreaking feels like an escape from the world we live in, where restrictions and the power of not only technology, but real life tighten every day. Jailbreaking is legal and it allows me to remove said useless technology restrictions put in place.
  <pre>

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">WHAT IS JAILBREAK?</h3>
  When you jailbreak your IOS device, you are able to install apps, tweaks, themes and more. Themes are where you install icon masks that change what your icons look like. I started out with making themes and respring packs, but after realising it wasn't hard enough, I moved onto creating tweaks. Themes required almost no code, just being skilled in the design front, which I was some what able to do so.

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">HOW DID I LEARN?</h3>
  How did I learn tweaks? Well creating tweaks is not easy, especially if you are starting out. The way I learn best is practically and learning by other peoples examples and work. Github is a god-like website filled with thousands of examples of code. Looking through github and how tweaks are layed out and structured, helped me lots. Along the way, your code knowledge will increase without you realising it. Remember, always be confident!
  <pre>

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">HOW DID I LEARN CODE?</h3>
  How did I learn almost three main programming languages in less than a year? Through determination and hard work. At the start, it was hard, there was so much to learn and I didn't know where or how to start. I started small and simple, then let my life take me to whereever I needed to be. If I found myself needing to learn bash, I would learn it, because it was required for me to move forward.
  <pre>

  </pre>
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">ADVICE</h3>
  What advice would I give to people who want to start? Look through github at open sourced tweaks for your ios version. Learn how they work. THEOS is required to make tweaks, which I have made a script to easily install it on my github. Knowledge of objective c is required to create tweaks. Like many, including me, your first reaction would be to google how to make tweaks, don't. I speak from hours of experience trying to find decent up to date tutorials that explained it well, but I couldn't. Of course, they teach you how to install THEOS and everything needed, but on the actual coding front, it doesn't teach you anything, only non-understandable information that you would not understand as a beginner. Don't waste your time doing this. Instead, look at my github and others github's that is linked at the bottom of this page. It includes code to tweaks that are very small, to very big. Remember, complicated code doesn't always lead to a better tweak. For example, I created a tweak called FastCC that speeds up the control center and is only 5 lines of code. It has such a big effect on the presentation of your device and how you interact with it, but it is only small. The web is your friend, use it as you please, but know where to look. StackOverFlow is a very good website for fixing erros. Reddit is amazing as it is real people giving real answers to your problems. There is a jailbreak subreddit that you can go on which is amazing, the home of the jailbreak community.

  <h3 class="w3-center">OTHER THAN TWEAKS</h3>
  What else do I try to make other than tweaks? I love making bash scripts which do all sort of things, from bypassing icloud lock on IOS 13 to installing THEOS and making a tweak template easily. I mainly work with objective c during tweak development but bash is a whole lot easier. HTML I am learning slowly. Personally, I feel like it is a lot closer to English than most people realise! I created this website with HTML, slowly and painly, but it happened.
